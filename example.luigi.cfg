# The following entry applies for any scheduler in the form of <scheduler>_jobs
# and limit the number of pending or running jobs Luigi can dispatch. The other
# limiting factor is the number of workers.
# The only exception is for the 'local' scheduler which relies on 'workers'
# instead.
slurm_jobs=1024
# Limit the total number of allocated CPUs on a given scheduler. This will
# prevent workers from needlessly waiting on pending jobs if all the nodes are
# busy.

# Limit the number of I/O-bound jobs
# The following are considered I/O-bound: prefetch, fastq-dump, cutadapt,
# fastqc, bamtofastq
io_jobs=8
# Limit the number of concurrent prefetch jobs which query data from NCBI SRA
# This is useful to limit as there is a diminishing return past a certain
# number of concurrent download jobs
prefetch_jobs=2
# Limit the number of concurrent fastq-dump jobs
# This is useful to limit since it often implies a lot of data moving around
# (through NFS) combined with a moderate CPU activity
fastq_dump_jobs=2
# Limit the number of concurrent cutadapt jobs
cutadapt_jobs=2
# Limit the number of concurrent fastqc jobs
# This is essentially reading large FASTQ files and writing back a small report

# Limit the number of concurrent CellRanger count jobs
cellranger_count_jobs=10
# Limit the number of concurrent bamtofastq jobs
# Similar to fastq-dump jobs, this requires a lot of disk I/O
